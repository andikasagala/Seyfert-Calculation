<b>Version 0.01a </b><br><br>
Seyfert Calculation is a calculator for Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Astronomy. Inside the 'Seyfert Calculation' there are many formulas also you can do calculation using 'Seyfert Calculation' software. Seyfert Calculation is free and open source, you can develop nor rewrite it into another programming languages also with your own logic thinking method.
