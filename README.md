<center> <h2>-----== Seyfert Calculation ==----- <h2> </center>

<b>Version 0.01a </b><br><br>
Seyfert Calculation is a calculator for Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Astronomy. Inside the 'Seyfert Calculation' there are many formulas also you can do calculation using 'Seyfert Calculation' software. Seyfert Calculation is free and open source, you can develop nor rewrite it into another programming languages also with your own logic thinking method. 
<br><br><br>

<h3>Purposes:</h3>
- Scientific <br>
- For Student nor Scientist<br>
- Anyone are welcome ( unrestricted based on culture, religion, country, etc ) <br>
- Community to fast find the solution of your Science problem with chat system nor website forum<br>

<br><br><br>
<h3>Features:</h3>
- Many Science's formulas ( Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy )<br>
- Calculation inside<br>
- No Advertising for all users and free<br>
- Clean, no logs, no spy and no user registration<br>
- Contact section for adding your formula in Seyfert Calculation software.<br>
<br><br><br>
<h3>Science Laboratory Concepts and Features:</h3><br>
- High Speed Processing Server for Computer Scientist<br>
- GPU Server for Physician, Astronomer<br>
- Enough just using personal Laptop/Notebook you can connect and use high tech Science Laboratory<br>
- Networking, DDOS, Virus, Trojan, Software Dev, Galaxy/Planet Simulation/Exploration, etc for experiments<br>
- Clean your internet line using 'Pluto Internet Privacy' before connecting to Science Laboratory<br>
- Clean internet line will connect and remote the Science Laboratory<br>
- Not the part of war equiptment, just Science Laboratory. Do not use the Laboratory for Live War. Science Laboratory. Science Laboratory. Science Laboratory<br>
- After you finish using Science Laboratory, all of your experiments will be deleted so the other users will using fresh and new Science Laboratory (P.S: do not forget to backup and download your experiment result before you leaving the Science Laboratory. You can get your experiment result using Pluto Internet Privacy feature, here the network sketch topology sample https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tlCg7dhxJKH-GCrQFEleUQLEN1K6arqI Your experiment result will be scanned with Anti Virus in each server. If your experiment result ie: Trojan, Virus, Software Dev, etc passed all of scanners, then it mean success. And will be downloaded to you. If your experiment result not passed all the scanners, then you get nothing in download process. You need more improvement in Science Laboratory. )
